The **output** of your projects is located in the **build** folder at the root of your solution (`C:\Users\SMA\Documents\SMA\SuperMemoAssistant.Plugins.Wozniator2020\build` in our example).

Additionally, upon a successful build, your Plugin files will automatically be **copied to SMA**, in a special folder named **Development** (`C:\Users\SMA\SuperMemoAssistant\Plugins\Development` in our example).

This folder allows developer to quickly roll out and debug Plugins, without going through the process of publishing a NuGet package.
